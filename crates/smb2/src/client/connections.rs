//! Every connection an [`SmbClient`](super::SmbClient) holds, and the one way
//! to reach the right one for a [`Tree`].
//!
//! A `TreeId` only means something inside the session that issued it, and a
//! tree DFS moved to another server lives on that server's connection. Sent
//! over the wrong one, it either fails with `STATUS_NETWORK_NAME_DELETED` or,
//! when the ids collide, reads or writes a same-named file on a different
//! share. So the primary connection sits behind this type: a method holding a
//! `Tree` asks [`Connections::for_tree`], and reaching the primary directly
//! takes an explicit [`Connections::primary_mut`], which only calls that have
//! no tree (share listing, the namespace root's own tree connect, reconnect)
//! have any business with.
